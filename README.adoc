== Activity:
* In this activity, we will be using the `bank` database.

** Find out how many cards of each type have been issued.

** Find out how many customers there are by the district.

** Find out average transaction value by type.

== Activity:

* As you might have seen in the previous query, there are 19 rows returned by this query. But there a few places where the column ``k_symbol`` is an empty string. Your task it to use a filter to remove those rows of data. After the filter gets applied, you would see that the number of rows have reduced.

== Activity:
* Find the districts with more than 100 clients. (Keep using the bank database.)


* Find the transactions (type, operation) with a mean amount greater than 10000.
